I am Ankit Mahato, a Full-Stack Data/Computational Scientist and an Educationist.

A die hard Pythonista, I am also an open source contributor and a former Google Summer of Code (GSoC) scholar under Python Software Foundation[^1]. With a decade of Python programming experience and 8+ years of industrial and research experience (Associate - JP Morgan, Data Scientist & Product Manager - Fuzzy Logix, USA) in machine learning, quantitative modelling, data analytics and visualization, I have developed an expertise in handling the entire data analytics pipeline comprising â€“ ingestion, exploration, transformation, modeling and deployment. 

An IIT Kanpur alumnus, I am also an active researcher with publications on scientific computing ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xDtZDNYAAAAJ&hl=en){target=_blank}, [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ankit_Mahato){target=_blank}) in international journal and conferences. An active member of the Python Community, I have delivered talks in [PyCon India 2017](https://in.pycon.org/2017/){target=_blank}, [Scipy India 2017](https://scipy.in/2017){target=_blank}, [Scipy India 2018](https://scipy.in/2018){target=_blank}, [PyCon India 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhbegsr8stc){target=_blank}, and [Scipy India 2019](https://scipy.in/2019){target=_blank}.

I am passionate about education and love teaching Python. My goal is to make Python programming accessible to everyone at all levels of knowledge and experience. After spending years pouring through boooks, research papers and working on real life projects across various industrial sectors, I decided to create Real World Python, a guide to help people solve analytical problems pertaining to any walk of life. 

Is a real world problem bothering you? Don't worry, I will help you conquer it!
