Titus 2 is a fork of the original Titus python library which resides in the (now defunct) [Hadrian repository](https://github.com/modelop/hadrian){: target=_blank }. Titus is not actively maintained by the Open Data Group and only supports Python 2, so this fork was created to actively support its development for Python 3.

Titus 2 is a complete, independent implementation of PFA in pure Python. It focuses on model development, so it includes model producers and PFA manipulation tools in addition to runtime execution (scoring) engine.
